------------

Tools to build Ulam (histogram) transfer operators and EDMD-based finite-rank
operator approximations for low-dimensional state spaces.

Place this file in src/chaotic/ulam_edmd.py

API highlights:
- build_ulam_partition(bounds, bins) -> list of bin edges per dimension
- state_to_cell_index(state, edges) -> integer cell index
- estimate_ulam_transition(states_t, states_tp, edges) -> transition matrix P (M x M)
- rbf_features(X, centers, gamma) -> feature matrix for EDMD
- edmd_operator(X, Xp, feature_fn, reg) -> finite-rank Perron/Koopman operator
- predict_pdf_with_operator(P, p0, n_steps) -> evolves histogram pdf via P^t
- evolve_pdf_edmd(K, feature_fn, grid_states, p0, n_steps) -> EDMD-based prediction on grid

Notes:
- Ulam works best when you can reasonably discretize the domain (low dim ≤ 3).
- EDMD returns an operator in the feature-space; to map back to densities we
  approximate action on a grid of states and renormalize to a histogram.
