## Overview
The project consists of several modules that cover:
- Chaotic systems (e.g., double pendulum, duffing oscillator)
- Diffusion processes (e.g., Fokker-Planck equation)
- Quantum systems (e.g., Lindblad master equation)

Each module includes utilities for simulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, you can use the provided `env.yml` file. It specifies all necessary dependencies.

1. Create a new conda environment:
   ```
   conda env create -f env.yml
   ```

2. Activate the environment:
   ```
   conda activate chaos-forecasting
   ```

Alternatively, you can install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can run simulations and analyses using the scripts in the `src` directory. For example, to run a chaotic system simulation, you can execute:
```
python src/chaotic/systems.py
```

Refer to the individual module documentation for specific usage instructions and examples.
